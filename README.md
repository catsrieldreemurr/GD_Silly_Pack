# GD_Silly_Pack
Just a silly geometry dash texture pack created by CatsrielDreemurr // Fern :D

# HOW TO INSTALL
Installing Geometry dash texture packs requires that you change specific files in the Geometry Dash Folder on your computer.

To easily access the files of the Steam version of Geometry dash:

### 1 - Open Geometry Dash's Page in the Steam Library

### 2 - Hover over the Cog -> Manage -> Browse Local Files

### 3 - Enter the Resources folder


Drag the Updated Texture file into the Resources folder and pick "Replace" when prompted.

Icon files must be dragged in to the "icons" folder. Once again, choose to Replace the files when prompted.

# REINSTALLING ORIGINAL FILES
Because of the way Texture Packs work, Steam will not flag them when checking validity of files.

If you are trying to bring back the old textures, manually drag in the textures from the "originals" folder into the Resources folder, then pick Replace.
